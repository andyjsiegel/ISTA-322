Like with the Spotify API, you need to go get a yelp developer account here: https://www.yelp.com/fusion. Here is step-by-step guide:\n","\n","1- Go to https://www.yelp.com/fusion\n","\n","2- Click on Start Free Trial and Click on Start Free 30-day Trial on Premium\n","\n","3- Sign Up and Confirm your email address\n","\n","4- After Signing Up you will see the Create New App page.\n","\n","5- Put a name for your app, you can select Education as Industry. As your contact email put it a made up business email. I used riazi@microsoft.com. Finally select Premium as the Access Tier (without Premium access you cannot fetch reviews from Yelp and cannot complete this notebook). You can put NA under description.\n","\n","6- Collect the write down your API Key. When you get the API key you can proceed with the homework.\n","\n","The goal will be to make a dataset of local taco places that are doing well during Coronavirus. Specifically, we want to make a dataset that takes their average score since they've been open and compares it to the average score of the last three reviews.  Shops that have been doing well should hopefully have these two averages be similar.\n","\n","There will be three main steps to this process:\n","\n","* First you'll search by location type and get aggregate information for everything that falls in the ice cream category.\n","* Second you'll get reviews for all those locations.  Yelp only returns three reviews when you call an ID, but that still works. Given you can only query one ID at a time, you'll need to write a loop to create a dataframe of all the reviews.  \n","* Third, you'll aggregate the latest review information to see how their average review score compares to their overall average review score.

After seeing how devastated he was when he had to close his first restaurant when she was a teenager, when he decided to open up another restaurant, Jessica Perjes (daughter and co-owner) vowed to never allow her father to feel defeated again and decided partner up with him. \\n\\nFast forward to 2018, Tacotlán was born in the same location El Ponchado was once in! It first started off as a regular taqueria until the pandemic hit in 2020. The father and daughter duo knew that they had to be creative to survive. Already introduced to their restaurant in 2019, they decided to bring the quesabirria back once again because they saw that it was a dish that was gaining popularity in California because it was a dish that was being made with beef instead of goat. \\n\\nServing the quesabirria started off as a special for the weekends only but after seeing that the quesabirria was selling out every day, they decided to keep it on the menu permanently. Now the quesabirria is the top-seller of the restaurant and they have an extensive birria menu.\\n\\nThis duo has not only been featured in the Chicago Tribune, WGN, ABC News, B96, Chicago’s Best,
