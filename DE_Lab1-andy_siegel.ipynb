If this was part of an ETL you would write up the cleaning and transformations into several functions that then are executed after extracting the data but before loading elsewhere. You would do this on a schedule to where say each month when new taxi data is uploaded you would go and run this and then update the aggregated data.\n","\n","**Note 2:** This is a pretty lengthy process.  There are lots of steps and times where we think we're done but then have to go back.  For example, we will think we did all our filtering, but then after making a feature realize we needed to do more filtering or filter that new column.  We do something to minimize the number of operations, but sometimes you catch something much later and just deal with it then.  If you were going to turn this into a function you would optimize the sequence of operations a bit more, but I didn't fully do that here so you can see what I mean.  \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pkUaxqiE1CuY"},"source":["## Bringing in our data"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"IW-0FGatpfrW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757030077903,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Andy Siegel","userId":"01854897995402915102"}}},"source":["# Bring in our libraries.\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","# Here I'm setting how many decimals are displayed for our floats.\n","# If you don't do this pandas will display like 8 decimals, which makes it significantly harder to make sense of when looking at it.\n","pd.set_option('float_format', '{:.2f}'.format)"],"execution_count":74,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"HppUpflpqJDE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757030081515,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":3611,"user":{"displayName":"Andy Siegel","userId":"01854897995402915102"}}},"source":["# We'll pull the May 2019 data direct from the website...

In this case I'm calling the pickup time, then using `.dt` which allows us to access  properties of the datetime column. That's followed up by `.date` which means we want to group by individual dates.  You could do other levels if you wanted such as second, hour, or even quarter.\n","\n","- The `.agg()`: This is saying how you want to aggregate within the groups (in this case individual dates).  Inside `.agg()` you provide a dictionary where the key is the column in the original data you want to work with and then the value is a list of math you want to do on that column.  So if you had just `{'passenger_count': ['mean']}` you'd be asking for it to calculate the mean passenger count for each distinct group (in this case days).\n","\n","This is a semi-complex groupby given we want a lot of things, but I think you can handle it!

apply.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"M-h3g3b6d62u","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":486},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757030117471,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":3407,"user":{"displayName":"Andy
