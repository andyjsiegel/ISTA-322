This week we're going to go deeper into the SQL world and start doing more filtering, aggregations, grouping, joins, and mixes of them all.  \n","\n","You've already been introduced to all these topics and learned how to code them in Python.  A fair question is: why do this in SQL vs. just doing it locally?  Well, two reasons.  For one, your data might just be too darn big to bring in locally, so it's more efficient to do this on the SQL server.  The other might be that even if your data is small it might be more efficient to do the bulk of the work on the SQL server and then bring it in locally.  Doing that would mean less data transfer and ultimately faster speed.  \n","\n","There are not strict rules regarding what you should do via SQL vs. Python, but I'd say it makes sense to do most of the simple selections, filtering, aggregations via SQL.  If you have to do more complicated work or a lot of exploration, it may pay to bring it in locally and work there.  But again, each situation is different so I'm not going to try and make a rulebook.  Use your best judgement.  \n","\n","What are we going to learn this lesson?  \n","\n","* GROUP BY - We'll first do some GROUP BY operations in order to aggregate some basic information about our movies\n","* HAVING - HAVING is a way to filter on the output of your GROUP BY.  For example, if you want to get the average rating for each movie, but only return those that have an average greater than 3\n","* JOIN - You've seen JOIN before, and now we're going to do them in SQL.  They allow us to bring together different tables into one.  \n","* Subqueries - Subqueries are, well, queries within queries.  You might want to get a query that meets a condition in one table, and then return only values from a different table that match that condition.  It's essentially query inception.  \n","* Odds and ends - We'll also learn some other random bits such as how to do math across columns, rename columns, expand our functions, make some new ones, etc.  "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Submission Instruction**\n","\n","1- Replace the blank with your name (e.g. DE-Lab3_Intro_to_SQL_Sara_Riazi)\n","\n","2- Run your notebook (all the outputs must be visible).\n","\n","3- Download .ipynb\n","\n","4- Submit on Gradescope"],"metadata":{"id":"b-NMQha590j6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"T9rhnLVEtQg6"},"source":["## Libraries and functions\n","We'll start by bringing in our usual libraries.  \n","\n","We're also going to bring in our functions but we're going to modify them a bit to give us more info.

This object handles authentication, network connections, and transactions. The cursor object (created from the connection using conn.cursor()) acts as your workspace for executing SQL queries and retrieving results. It allows you to send SQL commands to the database and fetch the results of queries. It is important to close both the cursor and the connection when you are done with them: the cursor should be closed first, once you have finished executing queries and processing results, to free up resources on both the client and server side; the connection should be closed afterwards to properly terminate the session and release any remaining resources.

But there are some issues.  For one, notice how the column name for our average rating is just `'avg'`.  That's not very descriptive, but luckily you can rename or 'alias' columns.  You just write `as new_name` after the aggregating function.  Let's alias the column as `avg_rating`.\n","\n","Similarly, the average ratings are not in any order.  Let's add an `ORDER BY` at the end to arrange by average rating. **NOTE** we need to order by the aliased column name, so in this case `avg_rating`!"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"YNx58Wor6qL0","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":424},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760835068463,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":45345,"user":{"displayName":"Andy Siegel","userId":"06615747887153843543"}},"outputId":"262a1797-3528-4957-c6c9-0f87f0547a51"},"source":["# Average rating w/ alias and order by\n","qs = \"\"\"SELECT movieid, AVG(rating) as avg_rating FROM moviedb_ratings\n","          GROUP BY movieid\n","          ORDER BY avg_rating;\"\"\"\n","run_query(qs)"],"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["       movieid avg_rating\n","0       191845     0.0000\n","1       177417     0.0000\n","2       185055     0.0000\n","3       208008     0.0000\n","4       195183     0.0000\n","...        ...        ...\n","59042   124174     5.0000\n","59043   159471     5.0000\n","59044   159904     5.0000\n","59045   187949     5.0000\n","59046   172149     5.0000\n","\n","[59047 rows x 2 columns]"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-2c2c34cd-c760-4915-ba45-76d1d71d8559\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>movieid</th>\n","      <th>avg_rating</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>191845</td>\n","      <td>0.0000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>177417</td>\n","      <td>0.0000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>185055</td>\n","      <td>0.0000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>208008</td>\n","      <td>0.0000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>195183</td>\n","      <td>0.0000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>59042</th>\n","      <td>124174</td>\n","      <td>5.0000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>59043</th>\n","      <td>159471</td>\n","      <td>5.0000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>59044</th>\n","      <td>159904</td>\n","      <td>5.0000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>59045</th>\n","      <td>187949</td>\n","      <td>5.0000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>59046</th>\n","      <td>172149</td>\n","      <td>5.0000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>59047 rows × 2 columns</p>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-2c2c34cd-c760-4915-ba45-76d1d71d8559')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-2c2c34cd-c760-4915-ba45-76d1d71d8559 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
