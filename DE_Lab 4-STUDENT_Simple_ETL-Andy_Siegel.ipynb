Now it's time to load data to it.\n","\n","Before we do that though, we're going to extract data from a bulk storage and transform it into a more useful analytical format. Thus, we'll be doing a full ETL pipeline today!\n","\n","The data that we'll be extracting contains daily numbers of Covid-19 positive cases and deaths by each county and state in the US. Most dashboards or reporting metrics are going to want values 'rolled up' into a higher level. We're going to do this in two ways:\n","\n","* We're going to want aggregate numbers by state. Hearing about high rates in some specific county might matter for some people, but most sources will want state-level numbers.\n","\n","* We're also going to want to rollup our data into weekly aggregates vs. daily numbers. Daily numbers are problematic as some sources only report on specific days of the week. For example, hospitals might not update their stats on the weekends. Similarly U Arizona doesn't test on the weekends. This means that daily numbers aren't an accurate reflection of the overall trend, while weekly numbers are.\n","\n","The last thing we'll do is some wrangling to make a unique primary key for each row.\n","\n","Once that is done *then* we can upload the table to our database."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Auw-NIWr92Nn"},"source":["## Extracting our data\n","\n","Extracting data in this case is pretty easy.

Transforms - Making a key\n","\n","OK, our `covid_grouped` dataframe is now rolled up into a format that we want. But since we're going to push to a database we need to also make a key. A **primary key** is a unique identifying value for a row of the table. Such a key must not be duplicated in any of the rows (it wouldn't be unique if it was!).\n","\n","So, we need to make a key. What should we use? There isn't a firm rule here, but ideally you want something that is easy to generate. We could imagine making a table of a bunch of random values and selecting from that. The only issue is that if we want to add more data, every time you do you'd need to make sure the key you're giving a row hasn't already been used. You could also imagine making the ID just from a squence, but again if you update you need to know where the sequence ends.\n","\n","Instead of either of those two options we can do something simpler. Let's just take the date in YYYYMMDD format and then add on a code for the state. Any updates obviously won't duplicate dates. Adding on the state code ensures that each date is then unique as no states will have the same state code.\n","\n","To make the key we'll do the following steps:\n","* Make a column called `week_start` that takes the date the grouped week began on and converts it back into a string.\n","* We'll remove the dashes from the current YYYY-MM-DD format\n","* Make numeric values for each state in the dataset\n","* Add those state numeric values back to the date string"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QuH97sTHagl-"},"source":["### Making our date string\n","\n","First we'll use our basic wrangling skills to take our date column and convert it back to a string with `.astype(str)`.
